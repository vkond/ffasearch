1) block iteration on large files and running FFA on every individual
   block and then combine the search results. It allows to fix (or make worse) 
   period resolution; 
   now it is working only for first block - I need to implement the iteration process
   command line options are --periodres or --mres
   this is issue 2a) from README

2) the way how I calculate the sigma, is it good or not?
   I calculate sigma on every period without taking into account the peak and surrounding counts
   other ways:
     - calculate sigma once on the raw-data (several windows to avoid RFIs)
     - take into account the width of the pulse - duty cycle
     - calculate sigma from chi-squared
     - implement all this (different options?) just to compare results

3) To plot double-period rather than single to avoid cutting the pulse
   I think it's not necessary here - during the FFA we keep only profiles that are folded
   with the true period (rather than with doubled ones).
   But probably we need to have another program that will read obtained *.ffa file and make
   the same plot with doubled period, or plot more than 3 candidates, etc.
   I would not like to put a lot of different stuff into the ffasearch program

4) the last period value in one FFA transaction is the same as the first period value in
   the next transaction. What I can do, and how bad is it?

5) The dosnr.cpp code now is upgraded to do smoothing rather than averaging!
   This affects the plotting as well, so I have to:
    - cmd option to choose either averaging (extra) or smoothing (extra)
    - to choose range of extra averaging (smoothing) rather than the max averaging value
    - update plotting functions as well to operate well for both averaging and smoothing
      Please, note that in both cases we are dealing with the different duty cycles and
      SNR will be maximum when all the pulse energy is accumulated within 1 sample, so
      the profile will be look like noisy spike and there will be a small (usually)
      number of points in a period. So, this is a thing to think about
