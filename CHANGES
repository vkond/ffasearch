------------

*) Correct the period values (there was an error in formula)
actually the error is in Staelin's paper as well

*) pbins options now means the upper limit on extra everaging OR maximum duty cycle
   I am checking the candidates from the lowest duty cycle for mbins and then increase
   averaging by 1 till pbins

*) In .ffa and .sft files I keep also duty cycle (DC) in percents (i.e. pbins)

*) Phase is in degrees now

*) Improving the code itself to make FFA run faster (though, who knows?..)

*) Sifting of the candidates
   in the final list now there are a lot of candidates of the same nature with a little bit
   different period, etc. I need to leave on the final list only the candidates that are not 
   related to each other. Probably, I have to write another program for this -- scripts/ffadmplot

*) Implemented reading of SIGPROC format
